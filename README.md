# Neural Network from Scratch using NumPy

This project contains the `nn` package and the `NN` class which exposes the following methods:
* `fit`: train the network on the provided training data
* `predict`: predict the class of a new instance
* `predict_proba`: predict the probability that an instance belongs to the positive class

**NOTE:** The `NN` class only support binary classification

An example usage of the `NN` class where it is used to train a binary classifier on a modified MNIST dataset can be found in the `example.ipynb` file.
